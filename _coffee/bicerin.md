Bicerin is a traditional hot drink native to Turin, Italy, made of espresso, drinking chocolate, and milk served layered in a small glass.

## Ingredients

Whipped Cream, Chocolate, Syrup, Milk, Espresso

## Recipe

Reference: [imbibe magazine](https://imbibemagazine.com/recipe/bicerin/)

1. Pour the melted chocolate into the bottom of a small (6 oz.) stemmed glass.
1. Pour the half-and-half and simple syrup into a steaming tin and use the steam wand on your espresso maker to heat and froth. (Alternately, heat the liquid in a microwave or small saucepan until steaming, then froth with a milk frother.)
1. Slowly pour the frothy milk on top of the chocolateâ€”it will sit on top of the chocolate, without blending.
1. Pull a shot of espresso (a double is best, but a single will also work), or prepare espresso on a stovetop maker.
1. Slowly pour the espresso into the middle of the whipped cream so that it layers itself below the cream, which will rise to the top.
