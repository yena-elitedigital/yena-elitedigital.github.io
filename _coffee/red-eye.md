## Description

Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_drinks#Slow-brewed_and_espresso)

Regular coffee (slow brewed as with a filter or cafetière) is sometimes combined with espresso to increase either the intensity of the flavour or the caffeine content. This may be called a variety of names, most commonly red eye, or shot in the dark.

Coffeehouse chains may have their own names, such as turbo at Dunkin' Donuts and depth charge – a federally registered trademark of Caribou Coffee. At Starbucks, a double shot of espresso in the coffee may be termed a "black eye", and a triple shot a "dead eye". "Caffè Tobio" is a version with an equal amount of coffee to espresso.
