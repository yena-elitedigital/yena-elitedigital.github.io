## Description

Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso)

Espresso is one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods, of Italian origin. The French also made a significant contribution to the invention of the first coffee makers, predecessors of today's espresso machines, and generally to the caf√© culture.

Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.

Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern Europe, especially in Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, but it is also popular in the rest of the world.
