## Description

Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino)

A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).

Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon (in the United States) or cocoa powder (in Europe and Australasia). It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.

## Ingredients

Steamed Milk, Espresso
